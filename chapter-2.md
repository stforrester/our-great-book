# Header for Chapter 2

Within this Chapter-2 markdown file, I have added some perfunctory text content to fulfill the "Creating a Merge Conflict" exercise in this canvas lecture walkthrough.

The purpose of this text is to:
- Highlight how GitHub functionality works with mutliple Pull Requests that can create merge conflicts
- Allow for the resolution of the simulated merge conflicts
