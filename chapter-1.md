Adding some text here

- here I have added in text that will trigger a Merge Conflict. Feel free to ignore the text in the header and below the header below

 because the canvas lecture walkthrough told me to do that.

## This will be the header representative of the Merge Conflict content:

I am adding this text into the Chapter-1 Markdown file so as to create a merge conflict when the Chapter-2 branch is pushed up to the remote GitHub Repo and a pull request to merge this Chapter-2 branch with the main branch is submitted.
